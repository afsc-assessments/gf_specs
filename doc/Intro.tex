Status and catch specifications (t) of pollock and projections for 2022
and 2023. Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in
the SAFE report issued in the preceding year (age 3+ for W/C/WYAK and
survey biomass for SEO). The OFL and ABC for 2022 and 2023 are those
recommended by the Plan Team. Catch data were through November 6th,
2021. The GOA-wide and W/C/WYAK ABCs listed in this table are before
reductions for the Prince William Sound GHL. However, the federal TACs
from earlier years reflect reductions from the ABC due to State waters
GHL. State waters GHL was computed as 2.5\% of the total W/C/WYAK ABC.

\hypertarget{changes-from-the-previous-assessment}{%
\subsubsection{Changes from the previous
assessment}\label{changes-from-the-previous-assessment}}

This year's pollock assessment features the following new data: 1) 2020
total catch and catch-at-age from the fishery, 2) 2021 biomass and age
composition from the Shelikof Strait acoustic survey, 3) 2021 NMFS
Bottom Trawl survey biomass and length composition, 4) 2021 Summer
GOA-wide acoustic survey biomass and length composition, and 5) 2021
biomass and 2020 age composition from the ADF\&G crab/groundfish trawl
survey. The age-structured assessment model used for GOA W/C/WYAK
pollock assessment was identical to the 2019 and 2020 assessments (Model
19.1).

\hypertarget{spawning-biomass-and-stock-trends}{%
\subsubsection{Spawning biomass and stock
trends}\label{spawning-biomass-and-stock-trends}}

The spawning stock is projected to continue to decline slightly in 2022
and 2023 as the 2012 year class is further reduced in abundance, however
with new fish recruited into the fishery, spawning biomass is projected
to start increasing in 2025. The presence of several incoming year
classes should result in a stabilization in biomass. However, the 2021
Shelikof Strait survey showed an unexpected reduction in the estimated
abundance of the 2018 year class (aged 3) relative to their abundance in
the 2019 survey. The 2017 year-class (aged 4) is still present in high
numbers, and a strong new 2020 class was detected in all surveys.
Overall, the Shelikof Strait survey data in 2021 showed a similar
biomass to 2020. Overall, survey indices seem to be providing similar
trends with closer agreement with the ADF\&G survey, as well as the 2021
NMFS bottom trawl survey results. An exception to this was the acoustic
summer survey, which was 25\% percent lower than the 2019 estimate.

\hypertarget{tier-determination-abcofls}{%
\subsubsection{Tier determination
ABC/OFLs}\label{tier-determination-abcofls}}

The model projection of female spawning biomass in 2022 is 186,481,
which is above B40\% (172,000), which places the W/C/WYAK Gulf of Alaska
pollock stock in Tier 3a. The model estimated 2022 age-3+ biomass is
1,097,340 t (for the W/C/WYAK areas) which was similar to the 2020
estimate (1,007,850 t) The author scored the current risk conditions as
Level 1 for all four risk categories, and thus did not recommend a
reduction from maximum permissible ABC.

The Team supported the authors' recommendation using the
assessment-derived maximum permissible ABC for 2022. The resulting 2022
ABC for pollock in the Gulf of Alaska west of 140Â° W longitude
(W/C/WYAK) is 133,081 t which is a 26 \% increase from the 2021 ABC. The
OFL is 154,983 t for 2022. The 2021 Prince William Sound (PWS) GHL is
3,327t (2.5\% of the W/C/WYAK ABC).

Pollock in southeast Alaska (East Yakutat and Southeastern areas) are in
Tier 5. The recommended ABC is 11,363 t for 2022 and 2023, which is an
increase of 12\% from the 2020 ABC. These recommendations are based on
natural mortality (0.3) and the random effects model fit to the
1990-2021 bottom trawl survey biomass estimates in Southeast Alaska.

\hypertarget{status-determination}{%
\subsubsection{Status determination}\label{status-determination}}

The Gulf of Alaska pollock stock is not being subjected to overfishing
and is neither overfished nor approaching an overfished condition.

\hypertarget{area-apportionment}{%
\subsubsection{Area apportionment}\label{area-apportionment}}

The assessment was updated to include the most recent data available for
area apportionments within each season (Appendix 1D.3 of the GOA pollock
chapter). For winter seasons, model estimates of biomass for winter
acoustic surveys conducted were used as a basis for apportionment.
Apportionments for the B1 and B2 seasons were based on a 3-year weighted
average of the sum of the AFSC bottom trawl survey and the gulf-wide
acoustic summer survey (unchanged from the previous assessment). Area
apportionments, including the 2.5\% of the ABC for the State of Alaska
managed pollock fishery in Prince William Sound, are as follows:
